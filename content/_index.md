      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I have a range of research interests in extragalactic astrophysics, with my primary focus on using strong gravitational lensing to study the Universe. This includes discovering strong lenses in large surveys like Euclid, modeling their mass distributions, and performing galaxy photometry to separate the light from the lens and the lensed arcs. Through photometry, I can also study the lens galaxy’s structure and stellar content. I am also engaged in research on supermassive black holes and cosmology inferred from strong lensing using the time-delay method. Ultimately, my key scientific interest is using strong lensing to probe dark matter and understand galaxy formation and evolution.
