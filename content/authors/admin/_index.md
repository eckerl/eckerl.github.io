  Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in astronomy at the [Universitäts-Sternwarte München (USM)](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)(https://www.mpe.mpg.de/), and part of [IMPRS](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/index.html) in Germany. My research focuses on strong gravitational lensing, dark matter, galaxy photometry, and cosmology. I am fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~stella/stella.html), [Prof. Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/), [Prof. Sherry Suyu](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~suyu/), and [PD Roberto Saglia](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~saglia/saglia.html), and to collaborate with Dr. Giacomo Queirolo, Dr. Maximilian Fabricius, [Prof. Tom Collett](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/thomas-collett), and the [Euclid Collaboration](https://www.euclid-ec.org/).

  My scientific aim is to leverage public and internal data—such as those from the Euclid mission—to identify and model strong gravitational lenses, improving our understanding of dark matter, galaxy evolution, and the large-scale structure of the Universe. So far, I have contributed to lens searches within Euclid, modeled multiple strong lenses, assisted in Hubble constant measurements using data from the Wendelstein Observatory in the Bavarian Alps, and investigated double nuclei in Euclid targets. For more details, please see my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0009-0005-3508-2469).

  I was born in Stuttgart and grew up in Neuhausen a.d.F., Germany. In 2018, I moved to Freiburg to pursue my undergraduate studies 
  at the [Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/) and earned my BSc in 2021. That same year, I relocated to 
  Munich to begin my master’s in astrophysics at the USM. After completing my master’s in 2023, I started my PhD in 2024.

  Outside of research, I am passionate about astronomy outreach and science communication. I admire the teaching styles of Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman and enjoy sharing the wonder of the cosmos. In my free time, I play classical piano and explore musical creativity.

  I welcome collaborations or even casual scientific discussions—please don’t hesitate to get in touch!
